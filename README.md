# Custom user activity tracking service

## How to use

First of all make sure that mongodb daemon is active at `localhost:27017` or go to `src/config.ts` file and change `connectionString`.

Then run the following commands one by one:

```bash
    yarn
```

```bash
    yarn build
```

```bash
    yarn start
```

Now you can open [localhost:8000](localhost:8000) and perform any tests
